# testing UML documentation

On Eclipse, complex, not everything up-to-date...
Papyrus looks a good option, provides its own eclipse version (good modules independent)

# StarUML , windows, linux, started in trianing.
# PlantUML looks nice for documentation inline, pdf with Latex and many other interfaces
